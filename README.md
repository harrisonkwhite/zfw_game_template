## Building

Building and running this project has been tested on Windows and Linux.

Make sure to clone the repository **recursively**, then build using CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

For Linux, there are a number of dependencies you might need to manually install. CMake will report if any are missing.

You can also use the "run.sh" shell script if on a platform which supports it.
